        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">All right, it's recording now.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Cool, awesome thanks. How's it going, Josh?</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Pretty good, I have no complaints. A good, good day. Happy it's Friday.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Going good. Yeah, I'm glad you had to jump on this call with me. So, I just have six questions for you about workplace communication during your time at TTM Technologies. You can take as much time as you want to answer them. You can ask me to repeat the questions, and it's really just supposed to spur conversation about the communication you had. Sound good?</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Absolutely.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Great. So, the first question I have is: I just want you to introduce yourself, your role at the organization at TTM, how long you worked there, and what you did. Just give us a bit of background on what you did for the company.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">So, my name is Joshua Brody. I've worked at TTM for a little over two years as an electrical engineering technician. Part of my role included developing prints, both mechanical and electrical, for new machines and current designs. I also did a little bit of traveling and repairing machinery in the field at other sister sites for the company.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Awesome, thank you. Very cool. So, my second question for you is: What forms of communication would you use most during your time at TTM, and which ones did you find most effective or at least effective?</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">So, I would say within my group, it was a very small group, so a lot of the communication I did was person-to-person, like face-to-face communication, and I thought that was the best way things got done and communicated. It was also important to send it over an email chain or a text message so there's a paper copy because otherwise, things would get communicated about new projects or the status of a current project, and you would tell a manager or a coworker, and it wouldn't go through all the way up to those who need to know. That kinda caused some turmoil within projects and keeping everyone on the same line of thought and up-to-date on projects. So, definitely face-to-face.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, yeah.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Face-to-face.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Nice, awesome. Cool, thank you. OK, cool. Third question I have for you is just hopefully a bit of conversation about the technical communication versus the non-technical communication you had at TTM. Like, maybe some of the audiences you'd speak to when it was technical versus non-technical and how you had to change your communication to tailor to each.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Sure. So, during my time at TTM, there were two sections of summer interns, both within our group and just the larger company, who would come to train with us. While a lot of them had knowledge within the STEM field, it wasn't exactly people knowing a lot about circuits or the sensors we worked with because we got people from a lot of different backgrounds. There was a big component of computer science folks, some of whom knew a lot about the electronic components and others who knew very few. We also had a lot of chemical engineers who tend to know a lot about electronics, and that's a big part of the job. So, tailoring conversation about projects and trying to make them understand what it is we're actually working on and how we can move forward as a group to solve a problem had to be kind of tailored to them in a sense of technical communication, but in a different way than if I was talking to one of the electrical or mechanical engineers who have that background and understanding of these components and systems. So, there's a lot of tailoring to the person versus just a general oversight of the systems.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, OK, cool. Thank you. So, you say there's a lot of like teaching components too?</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Absolutely. I would say a lot—</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">I like trying to help people—</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">—a lot.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">—understand.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, there's a lot of teaching to it. I would say that the one big thing was acronyms. My boss loves acronyms, so teaching all of those and learning them I think is a huge job, kind of hell at the beginning of working there and understanding them. And they don't exactly line up with what you would think they would mean, so it's kinda hard for those who are sort of more focused on sales or a non-technical role to grasp the broad ideas and understand what they are versus some of the guys who are more in that STEM engineering field.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Yep.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">They understand those better.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, that makes perfect sense. OK, cool. My second-to-last question for you—</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, sir.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">—is: Do you have an example from working at TTM where a lack of communication negatively impacted a project or a goal that you were working on?</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">So, an example I can give you is a project I was working on to develop a temperature sensor for a lamination process for the circuit boards. It was sort of pushed onto me to work solo on it. Developing the system itself was relatively easy and could be done on my own, but there were certain conditions that I needed to know from each individual site since they're all set up with different machinery. Some of them have much older lamination presses versus some of the newer or larger sites, which have newer machinery. So, the mounting brackets, distances, and the space you can fit the sensors in, as well as temperature, all varied throughout each site. A lot of the engineers that I was putting in contact with or was told I could get in contact with about this project had a lot on their plate, and they weren't super communicative with me, which made it really difficult to stay on time with this project and completing it. So, I did fall behind on the project, not due to things within our group, but just communication and availability of these other engineers and technicians at the other sites. So, I think it's definitely a huge—it can have a huge impact on the timeline of projects.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, that's a good example. Thank you. And then my last question for you is: What lessons or information about communication can you take away from working at TTM and apply them to a future organization?</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">So, I would say the biggest takeaway I have, when I move onto a different company, will probably be communication to customers. I think it's hugely different than communicating within the company. You have to be a lot more forward in understanding—you have to be more willing to go over things you already went over and be willing to explain it in a different way to the customers so they'll understand. Because it ends up being more of a—you have to play the customer service role as well as informing them of the technical aspects of whatever you're discussing with them. And customers also tend to be a little bit more difficult to get a hold of, and you have a shorter period of time, so you really have to know what you want to talk about and be concise and just have it down to short and sweet, basically.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you. I believe that wraps up all the questions I have. If you have anything else to add or any other helpful insights, you're welcome to share, but if not, that concludes the interview on my end.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Trying to think if I have anything else to add.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, maybe something that didn't fall into one of these categories of questions—some other specific communication example or anything else about the company that would be helpful for someone looking to get into that field to know.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Sure. I guess, more on the communication aspects, something like availability within getting in contact with certain individuals depending on their job can be a very different experience. For example, getting in contact with one of the engineering managers or a supervisor is usually relatively easy because you can just send them an email, and they're usually sitting at their desk working on it, and it just pops up on their screen. Versus dealing with someone like a technician who is out on the shop floor building an actual machine and only checks their email maybe once or twice a day. So, you either have to kind of be more on top of getting in contact with certain individuals, and you have to be wary of that. I think that's a huge deal, and going to another company, I think it's equally gonna be the same. Getting in contact with engineering tends to be a lot easier than the technicians or maintenance, and I think that, depending upon what you're trying to get done, that can be a huge deal—</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Right.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">—dealbreaker.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, that's a good point. That's definitely something valuable that I'm gonna keep with me away from the call, so I appreciate that extra insight.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Absolutely. Not a problem.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Cool. Thank you so much for taking the time to call me. I really appreciate it, and hopefully, we can stay in touch.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Very welcome. It was a pleasure, Kevin. Absolutely, I look forward to talking to you next, Kevin.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Of course. Sounds good. All right, thanks. I'll see you.</p>

        <p>Joshua Brody</p>
        <p class="answer">Take care. Bye.</p>

    <h2>Interview 2: Nate</h2>
    <div class="interview">
        <p class="question">Nate Interview Questions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Introduce yourself, your role at the TTM, how long you worked there, what you did, etc.</li>
            <li>What forms of communication would you say are most common while you are working. Examples: verbal, digital, written</li>
            <li>How does communication change when talking to other engineers, operators, technicians, interns, etc.</li>
            <li>Something I took away from working under you is the Purpose-Audience-Medium strategy. Can you elaborate on this idea and how it can help communicate effectively in the workplace.</li>
            <li>Any general advice you would give to a younger person looking to get into computer/electrical/software engineering in regards to workplace communication?</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="question">Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">So thanks for hopping on the call once again. Five questions for you, and it should take about 10 minutes, like I said. So the first one, it's not really like a question per se, but if you could just sort of introduce yourself, your role at TTM, how long you worked there, what you did—just like that. Give us a brief background of your time there.</p>

        <p>Nate Lobik</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, so my name is Nate Lobeck. I worked at TTM for about five years now, not including an internship that I did as a junior. After I graduated college with a mechanical engineering degree, I started at one of our plants, Stafford, as an automation engineer, where I worked there for about two years, doing some software, stock software automation, and some robotic work cell automation. After that—or in that time—I kind of got more interested in extracting data from the shop floor to make more important decisions on our processes and control our processes. That's how I kind of got involved with the advanced manufacturing group at TTM. The advanced manufacturing group supports all of North America operations on specialty projects. From there, I went to Stafford. I went to the main manufacturing group for the past three years. I have led the Industry 4.0 initiative.</p>

        <p>Kevin Leger</p>
        <p class="answer">Got it. So my second question for you is, what forms of communication would you say are most common throughout your time working there? Some examples would be like verbal communication, digital, or written. Just give us an idea of how you communicate on the job.</p>

        <p>Nate Lobik</p>
        <p class="answer">Yeah, I would say most of the external—so in my current job, I do a lot of external-facing support for our customers or the plants that use our products. And then we are also training a lot of engineers to use our tools. So most of that communication would be done digitally over like a WebEx call or something like that. But most of my communication day-to-day is via email. And then outside of that, internally, it would be face-to-face, so just verbally.</p>

         <p>Kevin Leger</p>
         <p class="answer">Perfect, great. Thank you. My third question is, how would you say that your communication changes based on who you're talking to? So whether that's engineers, operators, technicians, interns—just any variety of audience—how would you change the way you speak or communicate?</p>

         <p>Nate Lobik</p>
         <p class="answer">Yeah, so one thing that we practice in AMG is the idea of purpose, audience, medium. Those are things that you should focus on in that order when you're communicating something in particular. We use that more so for presentations, but I also like to use it just for a meeting or any interaction I might have with an operator or engineer. So, like, purpose being, "Okay, what outcome do you want from this communication?" Maybe you want to learn something from an operator, or you want to teach an operator something, or maybe you want to teach an engineer something or learn something from an engineer. So you start with that, and then you look at your audience and understand what knowledge they possess, what knowledge they might need in order to provide you with the outcome that you're looking for from the communication. And yeah, take the audience into account, like I said. And then medium—it doesn't make sense for an operator, of course, to use PowerPoint. It's gonna make the most sense to go to the operator where they're actually working, be in their environment. That's probably the best medium there. Of course, sometimes your medium is restricted. You might have to use a WebEx call. So, okay, how can you use the environment of a WebEx call to aid in your communication? Whether it's sharing your screen and actually walking them through some of the content, we try to stay away from PowerPoint as much as we can. We'd rather just show them—if it's software, just show them the actual product over screen share. Or if we're trying to demo a machine, ideally, your medium would be in person. If you don't have the machine where you can touch it, use it, see it, so yeah, that's kind of how we change our communication based off our audience.</p>

         <p>Kevin Leger</p>
         <p class="answer">Yeah.</p>

         <p>Nate Lobik</p>
         <p class="answer">That's that's kind of how we change our communication based off our audience.</p>

         <p>Kevin Leger</p>
         <p class="answer">That's actually funny because my fourth question was asking you about the purpose, audience, medium strategy. Like, I have it written in the question, so you pretty much answered it down to a T.</p>

         <p>Nate Lobik</p>
         <p class="answer">Yeah, really, we applied it generally to presentations because in corporate environments—in industrial environments—a lot of people just like to go to PowerPoint. And maybe that's kind of from schooling, where people are just assigned, like, "Hey, you have to make this PowerPoint." But often times, that's just not the best medium. It's actually a medium that could hurt your communication in general because you might have words up on the screen, and then people might be focusing on those words instead of actually what you're saying. So if we do ever use PowerPoint, we like to—one, you start with sending a document that people can read ahead. Generally, it's good to do that. You send a document or read ahead so people can get on the same page as you. And then your PowerPoint should really just be aiding your presentation. So maybe it's a picture of something that you're talking about or something like that, but it just should not be full of words. If your PowerPoint is full of words, it should just be a document.</p>

         <p>Kevin Leger</p>
         <p class="answer">Right, exactly. Makes a lot of sense. And definitely something that I took away from working there was starting to see how irrelevant PowerPoint can be. You can get so much more done with, you know, just actually showing the work. So my last question for you is, do you have any general advice that you would give to a younger person looking to get into computer, electrical, software engineering, or, you know, industrial operations in regards to workplace communication? Maybe something different than the strategy we just talked about.</p>

         <p>Nate Lobik</p>
         <p class="answer">Yeah, I would say—so when I started as an engineer, I think communication was probably my weakest attribute. And I think a lot of that might come from it just being an engineering major. It's not necessarily—I wouldn't say it's not valued, but you don't get to practice it a ton.</p>

         <p>Kevin Leger</p>
         <p class="answer">Yeah.</p>

         <p>Nate Lobik</p>
         <p class="answer">Especially like being in an industrial setting where you have a wide range of skill sets and knowledge, it's just—you don't have that experience yet. So I would just give them advice to make sure that you're actually practicing that. Make sure you're thinking about it. Make sure you're thinking about how to improve it. And it really is a skill that will make you more efficient as an engineer. The example I like to give is, especially in an industrial setting, maybe you're talking to someone externally from your company, like a vendor or whatnot. They could be in different time zones. A lot of our vendors are in different time zones, so you really might only get like one communication via email per day, right? Because they're gonna email you, and by the time they email you back at the end of their day, you're not gonna respond, and you won't get a response back till the next day. So if you're not very concise and purposeful with your communication—and what you actually need, and you know what you wanna get out of that communication—and then tailor all your communications towards that—if you're not doing that, then that could delay your project. Like, if you just need to communicate that idea of what you need, it might delay a project by weeks just by waiting on that communication to produce the output you want. So it really is an extremely important aspect of engineering, especially in the manufacturing environment, because often times the work that you're doing is going to be for a person with a completely different skill set and knowledge space than you. So it's probably gonna be doing work for an operator or something like that, or you could be reporting out to like an executive on progress. Both are gonna be completely different knowledge bases, so being able to communicate to different knowledge bases is really important.</p>

         <p>Kevin Leger</p>
         <p class="answer">Yeah, that's a great answer. Definitely something that I picked up on pretty quickly—how important it is. So that's very helpful.</p>

         <p>Nate Lobik</p>
         <p class="answer">Yeah, and it doesn't necessarily have to be—I'm not the most polished communicator. I know that for sure. I mean, certainly, it's something that I may be working on—being a little bit smoother in communications, especially verbally. But I would say I have gotten a lot better at driving at the purpose of the communication and not dragging out the communication. And that is really the important part: identifying the purpose of the communication and then driving everything towards that purpose.</p>

         <p>Kevin Leger</p>
         <p class="answer">Got it. Perfect. Awesome. Well, I wrapped up all the questions I have. You're welcome to add anything else if you'd like, but I have nothing else for you. And that was super helpful.</p>

         <p>Nate Lobik</p>
         <p class="answer">Yeah, I think that's all I have. Purpose, audience, medium is something that's helped me a lot. I would encourage people to really try that on presentations.</p>

         <p>Kevin Leger</p>
         <p class="answer">Thank you so much. I'll stop recording now.</p>
